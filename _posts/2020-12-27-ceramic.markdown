I cup the warm ceramic  
allowing its heat to blanket my mind.  

My mug houses green tea leaves,  
which waken with warmth and water  
blushing with the smell of childhood.  
My uncles, aunts, grandparents,   
their love of conversation,   
over tea and smoke and cards.  
I bond with them in spirit  
each time I blow the leaves away,  
each time I sip with caution,  
and follow the warmth down my chest.  
I slowly drift into memory,  
floating like the leaves themselves;  
my body and mind,  
participants in this proud ritual.  
A practice that summons the past  
to be cherished in the present.  

I smile, as young as ever,  
in this warm blanket of aroma and memory.
