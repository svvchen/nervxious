The end of my 2020 was as spectacular as you'd expect.

It's been a special year for me. And I don't mean that in a bad way â€” it's been a time for me to get to know myself, with mostly positive outcomes.

That being said, the tail end certainly was a shitshow. This fond memory sticks out the most.

## ðŸ˜¬ Part 1

On the morning of the 24th, I hopped in the shower, ready to clean myself up for Christmas eve festivities. Life was good â€” I was on my first day of PTO, and was ready to indulge in some food and drink with some nearby relatives.

After a couple minutes into the shower, I noticed that my feet were covered in water. It seemed fine, though â€” nothing serious.

...After another minute, water was up to my ankles.

I took way too long to figure out that something wasn't right. In my 3 years living in this apartment, I'd never had the shower drain this slow.

Of course, I did what any millennial does when confronted with a problem: go straight to Google. I did everything the internet suggested â€” vinegar, baking soda, draino, wire snake â€” with little to no success. The shower would occasionally gurgle a bit, but was barely draining.

Thanks to the apple cider vinegar I dumped down the drain, my bathroom now smelled like a fresh salad. Gotta find the...silver (-ish) linings in things, right?

While I was concerned, I didn't think too much of it. The water was slowly draining, and I figured I could call a plumber once Christmas was over. I got dressed, and went to a Christmas eve dinner, where I had copious amounts of food, including a cupcake. Life was still pretty good.

## ðŸ˜¨ Part 2

On Christmas morning, I woke up to a flooded bathroom floor. Santa apparently thought coal wasn't good enough.

My shower was completely failing to drain. The water level kept rising, without me ever using my bathroom sink or toilet. Google couldn't help me here â€” I called an emergency plumber, praying that they'd be able to quickly resolve the problem.

The plumber that came by was a good half foot taller than me, with a thick, russian accent. I got him whatever he needed, fully confident that he was going to scare the drain into working again.

After a half hour of work, he gave up.

The plumber explained that there was a serious clog in the shower line, meaning that when I showered, none of my water would drain.

What made it truly awful, though, was that all units above me shared this common line. This meant that whenever my upstairs neighbors showered, since there'd be no place for the water to drain out, I'd get all their runoff shower water.

I was lucky enough to learn this the hard way. As the plumber was on site, my upstairs neighbor showered. Her warm, shampoo scented water started filling my shower basin. I quickly realized that my floor was about to flood again, and rushed upstairs to interrupt my neighbors shower.

**Our conversation:**

Me: Merry Christmas! Hey listen, I'm getting your shower runoff because of a clogged pipe. Could you...not shower for a bit?  
Confused, slightly pissed upstairs tenant: Um, sure. When will it be resolved?  
Me: Oh, erm. I'm not sure when it'll be resolved. But uh, nice to meet you! Your shampoo smells great though?

After solidly scaring her, I ran up to the third floor, where I had the same conversation with the tenant up there, before finally returning to my place to assess the situation.

## ðŸ™‚ Part 3

First up: property management. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't help on Christmas, but could send a dedicated plumbing team the next day to check on the situation.

Hating my life, I slowly mopped up all the water on my bathroom floor. Then, terrified that someone would shower and re-flood my bathroom, I started transferring water from my shower basin into my toilet.

Using a ladle, I scooped water into a stew pot, and dumped the contents into the toilet once the pot was full.

.

This was the most ridiculous, miserable Christmas I've ever had. I was transferring my neighbor's runoff shower water from the basin to the toilet, over and over again, with the occasional flush once the toilet was full.

It was such a fitting end to the year.

There was a moment though, right after I finished emptying my shower basin, where I felt some inkling of happiness. I realized that I was more level-headed than I'd expected. There was nothing I could do about the situation, so I was letting go of the anxiety and negative emotions associated with it. And that was something 2019 me wouldn't have been able to do.

Slowly, I started enjoying my Christmas. I called my parents, ordered some popcorn chicken, and binge watched some fate/zero. I had a couple drink (ok, maybe 6-10 â€” I don't remember), and played/sang-along to some Mariah Carey Christmas music.

And as I turned off my bedroom lights, and closed my eyes, I couldn't help but feel so content with those last hours. I fell asleep immediately, dreaming of vaccines, clear pipes, and a nice, hot shower.ðŸš¿
