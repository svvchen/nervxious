Come home to mom.   
She's made food, but  
it tastes different today.  

I look to her, about to ask,  
But her eyes,  
swollen and flesh pink,  
tell me all I need to know.  

Head down, eat. 
Jaw can't seem to chew.  
Stomach can't seem to  
digest what was going on.  

Head down. Head down. Shrink.  

Later that night,  
from my sheltered room,  
I hear dad come home.  

He sits at the table,  
and after two seconds too long,  
I know for certain.  

The silence was louder  
than my entire childhood.
