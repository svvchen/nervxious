Come home to mom.   
She's made food, but  
it tastes different today.  

I look to her, about to ask,  
But her eyes,  
swollen and flesh pink,  
tell me all I want to know.  

Head down, eat.  

Later that night, awake in bed.  
Dad comes home.  
The silence was louder  
than any of my childhood.
