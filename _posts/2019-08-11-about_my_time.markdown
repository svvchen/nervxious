I'm young and dumb. Don't trust these opinions.

Working in Silicon Valley forces you to be a certain kind of person.

An *Operator*,  
*Badass*,  
*Creator*,  
*Ex-Founder*;

You Have To *Get Shit Done*,  
*Be Data Driven*,  
*Maintain An Amazing Twitter Account*,  
*rEaD sTrAtEcHeRy.*   

I'm not complaining here (besides the Stratechery). It's a little annoying, but realistically, people that are the most interesting, persistent, and experienced will execute far better than their colleagues. While I 100% believe that, I also forewarn others to not allow this attitude to **constantly** inform their actions.

When I first got out of school, every action I took, every thing I did, was to advance my career.

I read books and articles because I needed to be smarter, exercised because I needed to perform at work.  

I spent less time with my friends and family, and more time alone, in the office.  

None of that came from within; it was all action informed by my performance at work. As a ~~fucking annoying~~ side effect, outside of the office, I felt incessant guilt from "not being productive" or "wasting my time".

Now:  
1. All my friends hate me (slight exaggeration),  
2. My family abandoned me (again, little dramatic),  
3. (Only 100% truthful point) I feel like it's more and more difficult to relax, and to find things I want to do in my free time.

Try to learn from what I've gone through here. Have the wisdom to work hard, but reserve time for yourself to enjoy and rest.

Just some thoughts, what'd I know. Now, I'm going to go waste some more time.

After all, I've got some anime to catch up on. Until Monday, Mr. Thompson.
