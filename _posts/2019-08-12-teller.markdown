Each breath Teller took was short. Even though his body wanted more, his lungs refused to process the air. It was sharp, industrial, and lacked the oxygen Harar needed to sustain life.

He was on his morning commute through Midtown, towards the lab that he spent most of his life.

At this point, he'd been on Harar so long that it had beat his love of warmth into submission. He was trudging through the snow, socks so saturated with icy water that the excess sloshed around his boots. Nothing seemed to be going his way.

Teller saw the doors of his lab slowly come into focus in the horizon. The steel facade, which he saw every day, was painted with murals of past geohistorians. They were a tribute to the scholars and engineers who had built the lab.

As he pried out his access key and activated the gate mechanism, he couldn't help but feel anxious about today's agenda. It was, after all, the day of his centenial report; he had 2 full hours to present his dissertation in front of Harar's panel of native scholars.

As much as he wanted to do that, Teller had stumbled across several data points yesterday that were...troubling.

The gates creaked open as he shivered, slowly exposing him the to outer courtyard. Teller rushed to his lab.
