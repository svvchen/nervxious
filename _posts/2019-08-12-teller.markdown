Each breath Teller took was short. His body wanted more, but his lungs refused to process the air. It was sharp, industrial, and lacked the oxygen Harar needed to sustain life.

He was on his morning commute through Midtown, towards the lab where he spent most of his waking hours.

Teller trudged through the snow, socks so saturated with icy water that the excess sloshed around in his boots. He had been on Harar for so long that he had forgotten real warmth. It was a bleak and frozen planet; the wasteland of the galaxy, created for those that seeked solice, and focus.

Teller loved it.

He saw the gates of his lab slowly come into view. The building's steel facade was a dulled, slate grey, with no decoration besides a tiny set of etched murals on the west side of the gate. The murals contained scenes of past lab milestones -- tributes to the scholars and engineers who had built the lab.

As he pried out his access key and activated the gate mechanism, he couldn't help but feel anxious about today's agenda. 

It was, after all, the day of his centennial report; he had 2 full hours to present his dissertation to Harar's distinguished panel of native scholars (some of which were so old that they were depicted in the murals).

As much as he wanted to do that, Teller had stumbled across several data points yesterday that were...troubling.

The gates creaked open, slowly exposing him the to outer courtyard. He was home.

The place was a mess.

Papers were strewn across the lab floor. Most housed old calculations -- forgotten algorithms and derivations that Teller had played with as he started his dissertation.

He quite liked seeing the papers covering the ground; they reminded him of the snow white landscapes outside.

As he checked the nightly machine output, he noticed it again. The tiny spike in data from the measurements on Harar's Core.
