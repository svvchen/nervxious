Each breath Teller took was short. Even though his body wanted more, his lungs refused to process the air. It was sharp, industrial, and lacked the oxygen Harar needed to sustain life.

He was on his morning commute through Midtown, towards the Alliance lab that he spent most of his life.

At this point, he'd been on Harar so long that it had beat his love of warmth into submission. He was trudging through the snow, socks so saturated with water that it sloshed around in his boots. Nothing seemed to be going his way. Though, with larger concerns on his mind, the weather didn't bother him.

Teller saw the doors of his lab appear in the horizon. The steel facade, painted with murals of past geohistorians. His heart fluttered with anxiety.

He left the lab yesterday with a strange set of reports.

[To Be Cont.]
