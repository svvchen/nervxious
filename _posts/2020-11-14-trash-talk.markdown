Stop complaining about people behind their backs. 

I know ‚Äî it's tough to stop, especially when people around you do it all the time. But there's no faster way to create a toxic culture, one where people don't feel safe making mistakes.

Here's a rule that has helped me be better at this.

**If you think of something negative about a person, treat it as feedback, and tell them. If you aren't brave enough to do that, don't say anything behind their back. ü§∑**

Say you thought Courtney, a co-worker on your team, was lazy. You haven't given her this feedback. You're at a 1:1 with another coworker, and you're both discussing the progress of a project Courtney is leading. You blame Courtney for the project timeline being delayed, and are tempted to say something negative about her. It'd be easy to blame the team's lack of progress on her shortcomings, and label her as the source of the problem.

Don't. You don't know her side of the story. On top of that, you haven't been brave enough to deliver that feedback or have a productive conversation with her about it.

If you still find yourself slipping in a negative comment or two, remember: you are damaging the reputations of your co-workers, without even giving them a chance to improve. It's cruel. Eventually, it'll create a culture where everyone's afraid to mess up, or be themselves.

It all comes back to treating others the way you want to be treated. Try to maximize the humanity within your organization, and hold your co-workers to the same standard.‚ù§Ô∏è
