**Questions**

- Why does the padding come with the bibs, and not on the bike seat?
- Why don't bikes have blinkers? Have we just settled on taking a full hand off the handlebars to signal? How do we signal in the dark?
- Since I was previously a runner, what's the biking equivalent distance of a 5k? What about a marathon? I'll try to fill in the middle. 🙂
- Shifting front/rear derailleurs is strange; why do the left and right levers shift in different ways? Shouldn't it just be => push left = harder, push right = easier? 
- Why isn't electronic shifting more standard on bikes these days? I get they're available on [high end groupsets](https://www.thegeekycyclist.com/tips/shimano-di2/), but is the cost really that high to add to all bikes?
- Why are they called clipless pedals when you need to clip in?
- Why aren't there markers on the seatpost to center the saddle relative to the frame? There must be a subtle way of pulling this off, right?

**Observations**

- [Aero memes on the internet are hilarious.](https://youtu.be/5EE8m8mmq1k?t=154)
- Bike fitting is way more complex than I thought.
- Cycling kit is seriously expensive. 😅
- Bikes are seriously expensive. 😅
- The sound and feeling of clipping in is super satisfying.
- Cycling is amazing — really wish I got into it earlier. ❤️
