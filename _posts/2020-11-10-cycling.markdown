**Questions**

- Why does the padding come with the tights, and not on the bike seat?
- Why don't bikes have blinkers? Have we just settled on taking a full hand off the handlebars to signal? How do we signal in the dark?
- Since I was previously a runner, what's the biking equivalent distance of a 5k? What about a marathon? I'll try to fill in the middle. 🙂
- Gear shifting is strange — why do the levers work in opposite ways on the left and right side?
- Why aren't electric shifters (ones protect against cross-chaining) more standard in bikes these days? I get they're available on [high end groupsets](https://www.thegeekycyclist.com/tips/shimano-di2/), but is the cost really that high to improve the experience here?
- Why are they called clipless pedals when you need to clip in? I'm struggling with clipless pedals — I can't imagine how terrifying clip pedals are. 😅

**Observations**

- [Aero memes on the internet are hilarious.](https://youtu.be/5EE8m8mmq1k?t=154)
- Bike fitting is way more complex than I thought.
- Cycling kit is seriously expensive.
- Bikes can get seriously expensive.
- The sound and feeling of clipping in is super satisfying.
- Cycling is amazing. I wish I got into it earlier. ❤️
