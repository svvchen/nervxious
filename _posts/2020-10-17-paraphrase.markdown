A coworker of mine always used to paraphrase my thoughts when discussing complex topics. After reflecting on this habit of his, I've realized that it made conversations with him extremely productive. Here's why.

- **Paraphrasing gets you on the same page as another person.** If you paraphrase incorrectly, you know what differences there are in your understandings, and can start resolving the them. Once you've arrived at the same understanding, you can more productively move through the rest of the conversation.
- **You emerge with a comprehensive understanding of the other person's thoughts.** By paraphrasing, you are listening, learning, and explaining your understanding back to an audience. It's reminiscent of the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), a process where learners ingest source material, and pretend to teach it to a six year old. The idea behind Feynman's technique and paraphrasing are the same: in order to explain the origin idea, you need to have a robust understanding of it. After paraphrasing, you won't just be on the same page as the other person — you'll understand their ideas as well as they do.
- **Paraphrasing helps the other person validate or solidify their thoughts.** On several occasions, my co-worker would struggle to paraphrase my ideas. If the person paraphrasing can't make sense of the idea, especially after a few tries, it's a good sign that the idea needs more work. Of course, it's possible that paraphrasing helps you do this — I've often emerged from a conversation with my co-worker with a better grasp on my own thoughts.
- **Most importantly, it helps the other person feel understood.** The last (perhaps most useful) result of this exercise. If you successfully paraphrase, even after a few failed attempts, it's a sign to your co-worker that you proactively listened, and now understand them and their ideas. ❤️
