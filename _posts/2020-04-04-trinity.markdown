&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**O**  

Youth, summer crispness flooding over memories.    
Pages, crinkling over each other, crunch away.  
Exposing me to a spectrum of flavor, opening my eyes    
to a world where everything is fresh. Even    
love.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A**

Warmth, satured with earth and grass.  
None more wholehearted or grounded.  
Peeled, roasted, aged  
became sweeter  
than the world  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tolerate.  
But, with resilience, and punch   
it could last   
through generations.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**I**

Hardened with a skin of spice, fibers  
garnering strength  
from the earth that you absorbed love from  
Nobody seems to understand.   

After years  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoiding your love  
I never  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to live without you.
