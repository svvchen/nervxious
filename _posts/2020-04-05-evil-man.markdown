Imagine a human,  
tall, slender,  
feline, high-shouldered,  
with a brow like Shakespeare,  
and a face like Satan!  


One giant intellect,  
with all the resources of science,  
past and present...  
Imagine that awful being,  
and you have a mental picture of Dr. Fu-Manchu!  
The Yellow Peril incarnate  
in one man!  


Obey him, else   
all will die!  
After all,  
his intellect can do more harm  
than all of our weapons, combined!  


He is a doctor of philosophy...  
Of law, and medicine...  

But with this, what does he do?  
Torture the west, of course â€“ a doctor,  
only in name.  

As he terrorizes, plights,  
bides his time...  
Our futures are within reach  
of his long, jaundiced, fingers!  


Our women, children,  
haunted by his yellow, decaying  
smile. Vunlnerable to  
his insidious intent...  


Why does he not  
use his powers for good?  
We have never cared...  
for all his crimes (many),  
and the damage he has dealt (much),  
warrant no mercy!  


His tendencies, his tactics,  
represent the orient...  
We must wipe the earth of them!  
Else more doctors, nurses,  
Evil do-ers!  
Will spring up   
in his name.
