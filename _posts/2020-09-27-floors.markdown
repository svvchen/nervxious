I never understood as a child  
what it took to maintain clean floors,  
especially those pesky hardwood ones,  
with no places for even the smallest  
blemishes to hide.  

I never understood as a child  
why she insisted that I take off my shoes,  
why she needed to sweep and mop,  
scrub and wipe, and painstakingly  
keep it all so clean. Why it needed  
to be such an involved process.  

I never understood as a child.  

But as an adult with my own floors,  
I see that having them be clean,  
no matter how much vacuuming,  
scrubbing, mopping and wiping and sweeping  
â€“ it gives me a sense of control.  

Just one of several thousand things,  
that a child needs to experience.  
That becomes so apparent, far too late  
It's a cruel and impossible experience,  
to finally understand our parents,  
right as they fade away.
