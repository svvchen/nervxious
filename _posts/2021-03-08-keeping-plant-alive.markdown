I program a microcontroller to send a notification once my plant needs to be watered.

...Because I can barely take care of myself, much less another living thing.

## The setup
**Equipment:**
* The [Sparkfun Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13637?_ga=2.235359937.1768061677.1615260007-2127130474.1613147809), a tiny breakout board with two conductive pads that create variable resistance/signal.
* The [Sparkfun Photo RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13321?_ga=2.260386509.1768061677.1615260007-2127130474.1613147809), a dev board/microcontroller that's compatible with [Particle's web IDE](https://www.particle.io/developer-tools/).
* A couple [jumper wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11026?_ga=2.90123739.1768061677.1615260007-2127130474.1613147809), since I got the moisture sensor with screw terminals.
* My [silver pothos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scindapsus_pictus) house plant.

**Circuit:**  
* Sensor vcc -> d7 (digital) 
* Sensor sig -> a2 (analog)
* Sensor gnd -> gnd

**Code:**
Started from [this file](https://github.com/sparkfun/Inventors_Kit_For_Photon_Experiments/blob/master/03-PlantMonitor/Code/02-InternetHouseplantMonitor/InternetHouseplantMonitor.ino) written by Joel Bartlett, and made the following modifications:
```
int watering_state = false;// Added a temporary state to capture whether the plant needed watering.
.
.
.
void loop() //begin loop
.
.
.
delay(86400); //Ramped up the delay to run moisture checks daily. 
// Prevents me from getting spammed if I don't water the plant. For testing, set to 10000: 10 secs.

    if(readSoil() < 2000)
    {
      state = true;
    }
    else
    {
      state = false;
    }
    //Tweak if/else statements to adjust state according to the readings.
    //Calibrated to the pothos' preferred moisture level (~2000 on the serial reading).
.
.
.
//Added an if statement in the loop that would publish an event based on the watering state.
    if(watering_state)
    {
        Spark.publish("plantMoistureState", "Dry", 60, PRIVATE);
        delay(5000);
    }
```
## It's alive!

I plugged my board into my mac, ran a scan to find the correct serial port (` ls /dev/tty.*`), and connected to the board using a screen command (`screen /dev/tty.[port_name] 9600`).

After verifying that the board read could correctly read some basic values, I stuck it into the soil of my silver pothos.

Here's the basic readout from my serial port. Low at first, since the sensor is outside the soil; high later on, once placed in the soil.

## Putting it to use...

After verifying that the sensor worked, and playing around with moisture settings, I was ready to create my email notification. I did using [If This Than That](https://ifttt.com/home), a platform that allows developers to trigger and monitor events across apps.

Setup was pretty straightforward: create an account, and set up an event trigger.

Then, hooking it all up: I switched the board on, flashed the code, and dried off my sensor...

Huzzah! I'll still need to configure some settings (moisture levels), but it works!

Maybe, just maybe, I'll keep this one alive. ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤ž
