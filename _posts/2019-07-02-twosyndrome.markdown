Quiet.

Dead quiet -- the entire room. Everyone thought I was dumb. Didn't take a new-gen NEMS to figure that one out.

Course, only the guy with a 1.9 nodded along. He'd say the typical; a default catchphrase for anything that failed to register in his frail, rusty NEMS core.

"Looks good to me."

Of course it would. No pre-2.0 NEMS could properly understand what I was saying. Anyone with one installed would stumble over my proposed assertions and register my presentation as..."good".

Pre-2.0s were easy to impress. Problem was, there were higher versions in the room.

Two most senior contributors had state-of-the-art, high output machines installed into their nervous systems. They went to proper schools, paid, fought, and (though nobody acknowledges it) bribed for their NEMS. And it worked. Their brains were enhanced with the best intelligence anyone could want -- the types of setups that diplomats, nobel prize winners, and founders get.

And here I was. 7 versions behind them. Wishing I was born in a family that could afford to just put a 2.6 on me so that I could get by as a junior architect for the rest of my life.

2-syndrome was what they called it. People who wanted to work in the data architechture sphere but couldn't really compete with those that had 2.9+.
