I work at a company where every new leader comes in with a set of processes that they want to implement. As they reveal their grand plan for the new way of doing things, the org emits a collective sigh. People aren't good at handling change ‚Äî it's tough to not default to negative thinking when leaders propose a new way forward.

I've tried to distill a better way for dealing with it. Here's my (WIP) approach.

# Dealing with "The New Process"

Start by asking yourself: have I been through this before? Are there any parallels to my old experiences, or is it largely a new concept or process?

üîÅ ***If you've been through it***, tell leadership what worked, and what didn't. Of course, what happens after is straightforward: you either get what you want, or you don't. Regardless, your org benefits from your input, so let your voice be heard. In addition, if you successfully forewarn or champion the new process, you might even be recognized for your contribution.

üå± ***If the change or process is new to you***, embrace it. Assuming the new process is not blatantly bad, or requires heavy upfront investment, it's not a big deal if things go south during implementation. Leadership just wants to see you give it a shot. Do so, provide feedback early and often, and escalate if no significant improvements are made.

The most important part of this is that you'll know how the new process works going forward. With that, you can speak confidently to how effective (or ineffective) it is.

üîÄ ***What if it's a mix of both?*** If you're unsure which of the above buckets to put the new process in (perhaps it's a mix of new and old), do both. Call out portions of the process that mimic what you've experienced before. Make space for conversation about benefits and risks. However, after the conversation, be willing to embrace the process, especially if there are new aspects that you're unsure about.

As we all know, our careers are built off of experience. Without it, we can't form opinions, be good leaders, or predict/foresee mistakes. Be open to new processes, and view them as opportunities to run trials, learn, and accumulate experience. It'll only aide you as you progress through your career.
