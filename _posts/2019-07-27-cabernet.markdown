The grapes this summer  
have been especially sweet.  

Why?  
It's been a furnace outside, is all.  

When it's hot, we get riper grapes.  
The resulting wine is sweeter.  
Full-bodied. With high levels of alcohol.  

Gets me drunk quickly   
without that stale, stiff dryness.  

Being drunk gets my mind off  
those pesky Arctic fires.  

That killed my family.  
 
Everything works out in the end, though.  
So long as I have my Cabernet.  
My plate of charcuterie,  
My A/C, that keeps me  
safe from the hellscape outside.  

So long as I can live in luxury  
for just another day.
