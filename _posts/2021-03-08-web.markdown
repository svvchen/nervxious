In part 1, I tweak some code to send me a notification once my plant needs to be watered.

Because I can barely take care of myself, much less another living thing.

**The setup:**
* The [Sparkfun Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13637?_ga=2.235359937.1768061677.1615260007-2127130474.1613147809), a tiny breakout board with two conductive pads that create variable resistance/signal.
* The [Sparkfun Photo RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13321?_ga=2.260386509.1768061677.1615260007-2127130474.1613147809), a dev board/microcontroller that's compatible with [Particle's web IDE](https://www.particle.io/developer-tools/).
* A couple [jumper wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11026?_ga=2.90123739.1768061677.1615260007-2127130474.1613147809), since I got the moisture sensor with screw terminals.
* My [silver pothos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scindapsus_pictus) house plant.

**The circuit:**  
* Sensor vcc -> d7 (digital) 
* Sensor sig -> a2 (analog)
* Sensor gnd -> gnd
