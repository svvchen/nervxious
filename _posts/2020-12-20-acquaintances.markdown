Could we have known each other,  
in the past? A connection, we shook hands.  
No, more. We laughed together,  
with eyes locked and full of emotion.  
We did more than acquaintances do,  
enjoyed time together and grew,  
two vines, clinging to each other  
to slowly climb in the light of new day.  
We knew more than shared time,  
we knew shared experiences, even love.  
But pain, pain because of departure, pain  
that violently split emotion from memory.  
Now we stare into each other's eyes  
reminders of the amputated past.  
Each moment, an exercise in control, with shields up  
guarding us from a combined dose  
of pain and nostalgia and love.  

Could we have known each other?  
Yes â€” but no need to remember.   
Now, we are just acquaintances.
