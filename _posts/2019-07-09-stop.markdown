Do you hear that?

No, I know this is a poem. But seriously, take a second to listen.

I hear sirens in the distance.  
Rhythmic, pulsing. Disappearing, slowly.  
The upstairs neighbors  
stomping around in an erractic,  
human way.  
I hear the hum of the apartment.  
It's constant, and comforting.  

Everything's quiet for a bit.  
So quiet it's almost maddening.

Yet when I stop to listen,  
I hear patterns,  
and humans,  
and find comfort in sound.  

Moments like those    
are worth stopping for.  
Even if it drives you     
just a little mad.
