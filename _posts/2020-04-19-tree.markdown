The neighbors cut down their tree.   

When they first moved in  
they thought,  
wouldn't it be nice  
to have a tree. We'd have  
shade, fresh air.  

So they planted a sprout.  
The tree, it grew  
(as they do)  
branches shooting towards the sky  
roots plunging  
towards the dirt  
creating life  
beneath the concrete.  

As it grew  
the tree greeted the neighbors,  
with its seasonal tint,  
its waving, creaking arms.  

Its majestic posture,  
provided shade  
for the next generation  
of children.  

The time came, though.  

The neighbors went from proud  
to concerned.  
How could they anticipate  
that the tree would grow  
(...as they do)  
beyond their reach?  

It started  
blocking their perfect view.   
Rendering their freshly painted patio  
useless.  

And that,  
that was too much nature.  
No, no,  
scale it back.  
Call the men,  
control it.  
Else it might just  
eat up the house next.  

As it was being  
reduced to a stump,  
the tree looked around.  

Its view   
full of houses   
made from dead friends.   

And it thought     
"Oh, humans  
What a strange  
strange species..."
