The neighbors cut down their tree  
it was obstructing their view.  

When they first moved in  
they thought,  
wouldn't it be nice  
to have a tree, some more nature!  

So they planted a tree.  
The tree, it grew 
(as expected)  
shooting towards the sky  
roots pushing 
cracking the concrete beneath it.  

The humans went from proud  
to worrisome  
How could they anticipate  
that the tree would grow??  

Now, it blocked their view.  
And that, was too much nature.  
No, no, no, scale it back.

Meanwhile the tree  
looks around.  

At all the houses  
made from its dead friends  
and can't understand  
how humans think.
