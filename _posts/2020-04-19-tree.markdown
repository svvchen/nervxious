The neighbors cut down their tree.   

When they first moved in  
they thought,  
wouldn't it be nice  
to have a tree. We'd have  
shade, fresh air.  

So they planted one.  
The tree, it grew  
(as they do)  
branches shooting towards the sky  
roots plunging  
towards the dirt  
beneath our concrete.  

It greeted the neighbors,  
with it's multicolored tint,  
and waving arms.  

Its majestic posture,  
provided shade  
for the children  
of the next generation.  

Its time came, though.   

The humans went from proud  
to concerned  
How could they anticipate  
that the tree would grow  
(as they do)  
beyond their reach?  

It started  
blocking their view!   
Rendering their perfect patio  
useless.  

And that,  
that was too much nature.  
No, no,  
scale it back.  
Call the men  
control it.  

As it was being cut down   
the tree  
looks around.  

Its view    
full of houses   
made from dead friends.   

And it thought     
"Oh humans  
What a strange species..."
