The neighbors cut down their tree.   

When they first moved in they thought,  
wouldn't it be a pleasant addition.  
We'd have gentle shade, fresh air,  
new life, just on our doorstep.  

So they planted a young sprout. It stretched,   
with branches shooting out, like a contrail   
marking itself as unique in the sky's blue.   
Its roots set themsevles in the dirt,  
creating life, beneath the concrete.  

The young tree greeted neighbors,  
with its seasonal tint. Waving,  
and smiling with creaking arms.  

Its majestic posture provided  
gentle shade, and loving support  
for the neighborhood children. 

The time came, though.  

The neighbors went from proud  
to concerned.  
How could they anticipate  
that the tree would grow  
(...as they do)  
beyond their reach?  

It started  
blocking their perfect view.   
Rendering their freshly painted patio  
useless.  

And that,  
that was too much nature.  
No, no,  
scale it back.  
Call the men,  
control it.  
Else it might just  
eat up the house next.  

As it was being  
reduced to a stump,  
the tree looked around.  

Its view   
full of houses   
made from dead friends.   

And it thought     
"Oh, humans  
What a strange  
strange species..."
