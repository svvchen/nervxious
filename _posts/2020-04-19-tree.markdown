The neighbors cut down their tree.   

When they first moved in they thought,  
wouldn't it be a pleasant addition.  
We'd have gentle shade, fresh air,  
new life, on the foot of our doorstep.  

So they planted a young sprout. It stretched,   
with branches shooting out, like a contrail   
marking itself uniquely, in the sun's shadow.   
Its roots archoring themsevles in the dirt,  
breathing fresh life into the concrete below.  

The young tree greeted the neighbors,  
with its seasonal tint. Waving, and smiling  
with creaking arms, and a dance of leaves.  

Its majestic posture provided gentle shade,  
and support to the neighborhood children.  
At the same time, it gave the birds a place  
to sing. It gave the ants a place to crawl.

It gave the stop sign a dancing partner  
on windy, San Francisco days.  

The unfortunate time came, though. At last.  

It started blocking their perfect view,   
rendering the freshly painted patio  
...useless. Of course, it did not try to.  
Trees just grow, as the world tells them to.  

They humans quickly became concerned.  
How could they anticipate that this tree  
would grow, out of control? That it would compete  
with the view that it was once a part of?  

This was too much nature. Scale it back.
Call the men to prune it, chop it. Make it  
so it never grows again.  

As it was being  
reduced to a stump,  
the tree looked around.  

Its view   
full of houses   
made from dead friends.   

And it thought     
"Oh, humans  
What a strange  
strange species..."
