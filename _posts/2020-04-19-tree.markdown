The neighbors cut down their tree.   

When they first moved in they thought,  
wouldn't it be a pleasant addition.  
We'd have gentle shade, fresh air,  
new life, on the foot of our doorstep.  

So they planted a young sprout. It stretched,   
with branches shooting out, like a contrail   
marking itself uniquely, in the sun's rays.   
Its roots anchored themselves in the dirt,  
breathing fresh life into the concrete below.  

The tree always greeted the neighbors,  
It would wave, swinging its creaking arms,  
a dance of leaves following in its wake.  

Its majestic posture provided gentle shade,  
and support to the neighborhood children.  
At the same time, it gave the birds a place  
to sing. To the ants, a place to crawl.  

It gave the stop sign a dancing partner  
on windy, San Francisco days.  

The unfortunate time came, though. At last.  

It started blocking their perfect view,  
stretching its branches above the patio.   

Of course, the tree did not try to.  
It had just grown, as it was told.  

They humans quickly became concerned.  
How could they anticipate that this tree  
would grow, out of control? That it would  
conquer, like a parasite over its host,  
the view that it was once a part of?  

Of course, the tree did not try to.  
It had just grown, as it was told,  
by the sun, earth, and water. By the intent  
of the humans it had so cherished and loved.  

But the men came. The ones with machines.  
As the tree was being cut and dismembered,  
it caught one last look over the horizon.  

Saturated full of houses, all colorful.  
All made from dead friends. As the ax cut,  
it just could not help but wonder: how?  
How could humans be so cruel, and so loving,  
at the same time?
